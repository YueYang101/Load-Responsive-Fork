 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 254, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 1522 elements     
 for the given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs   
 are being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                  

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED).

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
